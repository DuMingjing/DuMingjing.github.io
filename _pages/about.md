Welcome!  I am an Associate Professor with the [*School of Computer Science and Technology*](http://eit.jsnu.edu.cn/) at [*Jiangsu Normal University*](http://www.jsnu.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D degree in computer science from China University of Mining and Technology, China. I have served as reviewer of many important academic Journals such as IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, Pattern Recognition, World Wide Web, Information Sciences. My research interests include data mining and machine learning, specialized in cluster analysis and time series analysis.
