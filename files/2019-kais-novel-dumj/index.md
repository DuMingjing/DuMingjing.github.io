abstract: "The density peaks (DP) clustering approach is a novel density-based clustering
algorithm. On the basis of the prior assumption of consistency for semi-supervised learning
problems, we further make the assumptions of consistency for density-based clustering. The
first one is the assumption of the local consistency, which means nearby points are likely to
have the similar local density; the second one is the assumption of the global consistency,
which means points on the same high-density area (or the same structure, i.e., the same
cluster) are likely to have the same label. According to the first assumption, we provide a
new option based on the sensitivity of the local density for the local density. In addition,
we redefine Î´ and redesign the assignation strategy based on a new density-adaptive metric
according to the second assumption. We compare the performance of our algorithm with
traditional clustering schemes, including DP, K-means, fuzzy C-means, Gaussian mixture
model, and self-organizing maps. Experiments on different benchmark data sets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
