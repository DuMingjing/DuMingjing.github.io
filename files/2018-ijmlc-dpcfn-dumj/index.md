abstract: "The density peaks (DP) clustering approach, a
novel density-based clustering algorithm, detects clusters
with arbitrary shape. However, this method uses a crisp
neighborhood relation to calculate local density. It cannot
identify the different values of the neighborhood membership degrees of the points with respect to different distances
from core point. The proposed FN-DP (fuzzy neighborhood density peaks) clustering algorithm uses fuzzy neighborhood relation to define the local density in FJP (fuzzy
joint points) algorithm. The proposed algorithm integrates
the speed of DP clustering algorithm with the robustness of
FJP algorithm. The experimental results illustrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared with the DP
clustering approach."
